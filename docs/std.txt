throws 1
#fpart
desc "Returns the fractional part of the number."

#hsort
desc "Returns a sorted array. This function also needs a comparison function. Heapsort, which always has an O(n log n) time complexity and an O(1) space complexity but is not stable and is generally slower than quicksort, is used for this function."
throws 1
#qsort
desc "Returns a sorted array. This function also needs a comparison function. Quicksort, which may occasionally have an O(n^2) time complexity (although use of randomization guarantees O(n log n) complexity in virtually all cases) but is stable unlike heapsort, is used for this function."
throws 1
#msort
desc "Returns a sorted linked list. This function also needs a comparison function. An implementation of mergesort for linked lists, which has an O(n log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, is used."

#gettype
desc "Gets the type of the input."
#yield
desc "Produces a list from #1 up to, but not including, #2. If #3 is present, then produces a list of what the function yields. If #4 is specified and true, then produces a linked list; otherwise, produces an array."
#stib
