#idiv
desc "Integer divides zero or more values from the first argument. Note that this does not accept floating-point values."
vector
throws 1
#mod
desc "Finds the remainder of two integers. If more than two arguments are present, folds the operation from left to right."
vector
throws 1
#hluna
desc "Displays the argument to the homescreen in the GUI. It might also be useful to note that the value is also shown in the terminal with the prefix `[hluna]'."
#negate
desc "Returns the additive inverse of an argument."
vector
throws 1
#avg
desc "Takes the average of two numbers."
vector
throws 1
#eq

desc "Returns true if the first value is less than the second; false otherwise."
vector
#ge
desc "Returns true if the first value is greater than or equal to the second; false otherwise."
vector
#le
desc "Returns true if the first value is less than or equal to the second; false otherwise."
vector
#abs
desc "Returns the absolute value of a number."
vector
throws 1
#cons
desc "Returns an element prepended to a list or string."
throws 1
#car
desc "Returns the first element of a list or string."
throws 1
#cdr
desc "Returns a list containing all but the first element of a list or string."
throws 1
#econs
desc "Returns an element appended to a list or string."
throws 1
#ecar
desc "Returns the last element of a list or string."
throws 1
#ecdr
desc "Returns a list containing all but the last element of a list or string."
throws 1
#expr
desc "Evaluates the amethyst expression passed as an argument."
#len
desc "Returns the length of a list, string, or number."
throws 1
#now
desc "Returns the current time in milliseconds after Jan. 1, 1970."
#sub
desc "Returns the subcollection of the collection #1 from index #2 to #3 (or the end if #3 is undefined)."
throws 1
#str
desc "Returns the string representation for any value. Useful for concatenating to strings."
#rrbzo
desc "Returns a random real between zero and one. Might return 0, but never returns 1."
#floor
desc "Returns the floor of the number."
throws 1
#fpart
desc "Returns the fractional part of the number."
throws 1
#map
desc "Maps one or more lists to a function (the last argument). All lists must have the same length."
throws 1
#foldl
desc "Given a list (#1), a base value (#2), and a function (#3), applies #3 over #2 and each element of #1 (starting from the first)."
throws 1
#foldr
desc "Given a list (#1), a base value (#2), and a function (#3), applies #3 over #2 and each element of #1 (starting from the last)."
throws 1
#filter
desc "Returns a list with all of the elements of #1 which, when passed to #2, return true values."
throws 1
#dsa
desc "Returns a disassembly of a function. Useful in debugging the compiler."
throws 1
#hsort
desc "Returns a sorted array. This function also needs a comparison function. Heapsort, which always has an O(n log n) time complexity and an O(1) space complexity but is not stable and is generally slower than quicksort, is used for this function."
throws 1
#qsort
desc "Returns a sorted array. This function also needs a comparison function. Quicksort, which may occasionally have an O(n^2) time complexity (although use of randomization guarantees O(n log n) complexity in virtually all cases) but is stable unlike heapsort, is used for this function."
throws 1
#msort
desc "Returns a sorted linked list. This function also needs a comparison function. An implementation of mergesort for linked lists, which has an O(n log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity, is used."
throws 1
#help
desc "Help function."
#ribzpt
desc "Returns a random integer between a zero and a power of 2 (2^#1)."
