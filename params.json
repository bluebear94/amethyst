{"name":"Amethyst","tagline":"$:hluna(\"A programming language","body":"### amethyst ([soon to be renamed](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1R-epMSA_GaeaEZilc_D6k8vo8TXJMvZDZlgQDMFsHFQ/viewform))\r\n\r\nA programming language with both minimalism and utility in mind. It is inspired by TI-Basic.\r\n\r\n### Example?\r\n\r\n```\r\n_ Returns the nth Fibonacci number.\r\n_ For n = 0, produces an extraneous result of 1.\r\n$fib = λ\r\n  l = 0\r\n  u = 1\r\n  For i, 2, #1\r\n    t = u\r\n    u += l\r\n    l = t\r\n  EndFor\r\n  u\r\nEndλ\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Version 0.5.x\r\n\r\nLater versions may contain functions missing in earlier versions. The latest is **0.5.12**.\r\n\r\n### Roadmap to 0.6\r\n\r\n- [x] bitwise operators\r\n- [x] math functions\r\n- [x] time functions\r\n- [ ] collection functions\r\n- [ ] random functions\r\n\r\nIn order to enhance friendliness to new programmers, the `=` token will now be interpreted as equality, and assignment will use a left arrow (which will be available for input on the GUI).\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n\r\n#### Will named parameters be supported; e. g. `f(x)=x^2`?\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to support named parameters at this moment.\r\n\r\n#### Why do you plan to rename Amethyst?\r\n\r\nAlready taken.\r\n\r\n#### Are there any communities I can join?\r\n\r\nThere will be as soon as we agree upon a new name.\r\n\r\n#### How do I install?\r\n\r\n[あなたばかです。](https://github.com/bluebear94/amethyst/blob/master/README.md)\r\n\r\n#### Why does, for example, calling `$:cdr` on a large list take so much time?\r\n\r\nAmethyst vigilantly clones values on assignment, in order to avoid unnecessary mutation and model TI-Basic. Chances are that you can use a function such as `$:foldl` to do the same thing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
